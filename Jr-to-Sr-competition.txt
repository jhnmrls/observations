I've been a Junior long ago, and I wanted to showcase my talent to get promoted.

What I used as strategy to win against a Senior level.

1). Absolute Skill

but based on my observation as I become a (Sr.) some are using these (see below) to get ahead.

2). Cherry-picking of task (This way they will look good in the paper, on the sheer number of task accomplished - Only happens when Task Management is Bad or Tasks are not effectively measured).
3). Protecting / Not sharing knowledge.
4). Out-casting, They're on a group, but will exclude you (This includes skype group, a task force (work related), team).
